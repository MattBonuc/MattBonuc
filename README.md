## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
University student in Automation with a strong passion for modeling and controlling complex systems. I am interested in combining concepts from mechanics, electronics, and computer science to develop innovative solutions. I am deepening my knowledge in optimal control, reliability analysis, and physical system modeling through interdisciplinary approaches. I am a big fan of team sports and enjoy working in teams, finding motivation and inspiration in collaboration. In my free time, I pursue my passion for fishing and swimming. My goal is to acquire advanced skills to tackle the challenges of industrial automation and intelligent systems.
